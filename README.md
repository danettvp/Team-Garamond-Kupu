# Team Garamond Kupu POC

## Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept that explores how playful mini-games can support learners of te reo Māori.  
The app introduces three mini games: Memory match, syllable Game, and fill in the blank to to help users build vocabulary, reinforce recall, and connect kupu (words) with meaning in context.

## Problem & Inspiration

The current Kupu app is very limited, only letting users translate their words and hear the pronunciation, but not really use them in memorable ways. For rangatahi, especially those hearing te reo Māori regularly in classrooms, this doesn’t feel engaging enough to spark deeper learning.

We saw an opportunity to:  
- Make learning kupu fun and interactive through games  
- Have leaderboards to encourage them to get XP and have friendly competition while learning
- Support rangatahi by connecting to the reo they already hear at school  
- Turn the passive learning into an active and playful experience

- **Pick a game**
  (index.html) Pick a game

  (pronunciation.html) Break kupu into syllables, then selecting the correct order and syllables of their kupu, to help spelling and pronunciation.

- **Fill in the Blank**  
  (blank.html) Complete simple sentences by choosing the correct kupu, building familiarity with kupu when in everyday contexts.

## Known Issues / Limitations

- Prototype visuals are minimal, focused on functionality only  
- Content set is small and not yet comprehensive  
- Limited game mechanics (no scoring beyond matches/answers)  
- No mobile responsiveness beyond basic layouts  
- For memory match, if incorrect flip, wait for cards to flip back then try again (otherwise will bug out)
